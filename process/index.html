                    <p class="mb-3">
                        CAVEMAN started out as a group of ambitious electrical and computer engineering students wanting to make a cool mechatronic/robotic project. Most of the members had worked together beforehand with successful outcomes, so the next step was something a bit bigger. The first initial idea was a Moon rover that would navigate and build roads on the moon using regolith sintering and brick laying. Outreach and resources on that front were a bit limited despite Pitt building up its space academics and research. Outreach from Carnegie Robotics Laboratory were more fruitful in problem discovery, leading us to look into cave and mine robotics. They also introduced us to the realm of Photogrammetry, which made up a large part of our mapping pipeline.

                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Carnegie Robotics Laboratory also referred us to Mine Vision Sytems, giving us insight on methods and technologies that we utilized in our final system, such as RTABMAP. Working with Pitt's Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, we learned more about the current issues with caves, such as their inaccurate and outdated mapping, giving us more motivation in this problem space. This resulted in our transition from a space rover into a cave rover, equipping us with better access to testing facilities and reducing the constraints to ensure higher project feasibility in the single semester timeframe. Working with the vice chair of the ECE department as our advisor, he steered us clear of other ideas that come with much higher complication and logistics, like drones, and also provided us with additional resources, like an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, to smoothly aid our robotics journey. More outreach in the ECE department helped us work out power and motor considerations, and our connections with the Bioengineering Department secured us a private workspace.

							The University of Pittsburgh ECE Department provided a lot of funds and resources that were utterly crucial for the success of this project. This funding was secured through a strong rapport with the department and a guarantee of delivering on our project.

					<p class="mb-3">
						Despite many successes in outreach, a lot of avenues bore no fruit. We tried working with MSHA, CMU's NREC, and many others in the mining and robotics community in Pittsburgh, but we were declined; while they would have been very helpful, this had very little hindrance on our end result besides providing a few more areas to explore and map.
